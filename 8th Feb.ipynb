    "Data abstraction is one of the most essential concepts of Python OOPs which is used to hide irrelevant details from the user and show the details that are relevant to the users.A simple example of this can be a car. A car has an accelerator, clutch, and break and we all know that pressing an accelerator will increase the speed of the car and applying the brake can stop the car but we donâ€™t know the internal mechanism of the car and how these functionalities can work this detail hiding is known as data abstraction."

    "#1. Classes and Objects: \n",
    "#   Classes are blueprints for creating objects. \n",
    "#   They encapsulate data and functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Encapsulation: \n",
    "#   This involves wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit, the class. \n",
    "#   Encapsulation helps to hide the internal state of the object from the outside world and only expose necessary \n",
    "#   functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Access Modifiers: \n",
    "#   Python uses conventions to indicate the intended level of access for attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Public: \n",
    "#   Accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "#5. Protected: \n",
    "#   Indicated by a single underscore (_). \n",
    "#   Itâ€™s a convention that it should be treated as non-public.\n",
    "#6. Private: \n",
    "#   Indicated by double underscores (__). \n",
    "#   This performs name mangling to make the attribute less accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "#7. Properties and Getters/Setters: \n",
    "#   Properties in Python allow you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. \n",
    "#   Getters and setters are methods used to get and set the values of private attributes."
